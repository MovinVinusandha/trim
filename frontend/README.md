# Frontend Application - trim

Modern single-page application (SPA) built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, featuring link management, interactive analytics, dynamic QR codes, and multi-subdomain routing support.

## Key Features

- **Framer Motion Animations**: Fluid page transitions, modal dialog animations, and interactive hover states using Framer Motion with `AnimatePresence`.
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Dedicated skeleton loading placeholders preventing layout shifts during asynchronous data fetches across tables and cards.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Comprehensive analytics charts powered by Recharts (30-day click trends, device pie charts, OS distribution bars, top browser metrics, and country statistics).
- **Toast Notification System**: Integrated `react-hot-toast` notifications providing contextual feedback for API operations, clipboard actions, and coming-soon alerts.
- **Shared Layout Architecture**: Centralized `DashboardLayout` wrapping authenticated routes with a persistent sidebar, active navigation indicators, theme toggles, and responsive mobile drawers.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Light and dark mode support managed through React Context (`ThemeContext`) and persisted in local storage.
- **Subdomain Routing Support**: Built-in compatibility with the 3-pillar subdomain architecture (`app.trim.com` for application views and `trim.com` for root landing and link resolution).
